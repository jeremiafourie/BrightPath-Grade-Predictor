# Notebook Folder

## Overview

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, experimentation, and documentation of the `BrightPath-Grade-Predictor` project workflow.

## Contents

- **EDA Notebooks**: Notebooks for exploratory data analysis (e.g., `eda_univariate.ipynb`, `eda_bivariate.ipynb`).
- **Modeling Notebooks**: Notebooks for model development and evaluation (e.g., `model_training.ipynb`).
- **Experimentation**: Notebooks for testing different approaches (e.g., `feature_engineering_experiments.ipynb`).

## Notes

- Use these notebooks for interactive analysis, visualization, and documenting findings.
- Outputs like plots or models should be saved to the `artifacts` folder.
- Ensure notebooks are well-documented with markdown cells for clarity.
