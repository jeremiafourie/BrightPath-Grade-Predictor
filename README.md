# BrightPath-Grade-Predictor

A predictive modeling project to classify student performance (GradeClass) at BrightPath Academy using demographic, study, and extracurricular data.

## 📚 Project Overview

This is a group project for Belgium Campus to predict student performance (GradeClass) at BrightPath Academy using academic, demographic, and extracurricular data. We aim to identify at-risk students, assess extracurricular impacts, and suggest support strategies through EDA and predictive modeling.

### Problem Statement

BrightPath Academy faces challenges in identifying at-risk students early, understanding how extracurricular activities influence grades, and developing targeted support strategies. This project addresses these issues by building a predictive model for `GradeClass` and analyzing key factors affecting student outcomes.

### Hypotheses

We hypothesize that:

- Students with higher `StudyTimeWeekly` are more likely to achieve better grades.
- Higher `Absences` correlate with lower grades.
- Participation in `Extracurricular` activities positively impacts grades.
- `ParentalSupport` levels significantly influence student performance.

These hypotheses will be explored and tested in the `notebooks/02_eda.ipynb` notebook through data visualizations and statistical analysis.
