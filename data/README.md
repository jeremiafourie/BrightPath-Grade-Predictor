# Data Folder

## Overview

This folder contains all datasets used in the `BrightPath-Grade-Predictor` project, including raw and processed data for predicting student performance (`GradeClass`).

## Contents

- **Raw Data**: Original dataset (e.g., `Student_performance_data.csv`) as provided, unchanged.
- **Processed Data**: Cleaned or transformed datasets (e.g., `processed_student_data.csv`) after preprocessing steps like encoding or feature engineering.
- **Metadata**: Documentation about the dataset (e.g., `data_description.md` explaining columns like `StudyTimeWeekly`, `GradeClass`).

## Notes

- Do not modify raw data files to preserve the original dataset.
- Processed data is generated by scripts in the `src` folder or notebooks in the `notebook` folder.
- Large data files may be excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
