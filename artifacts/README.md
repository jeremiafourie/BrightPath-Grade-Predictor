# Artifacts Folder

## Overview

This folder stores outputs and artifacts generated during the `BrightPath-Grade-Predictor` project, such as trained models, predictions, visualizations, and evaluation metrics.

## Contents

- **Trained Models**: Serialized model files (e.g., `grade_predictor_model.pkl`) after training the predictive model for `GradeClass`.
- **Predictions**: Output files with model predictions (e.g., `predictions.csv` containing predicted `GradeClass` for each student).
- **Visualizations**: Saved plots from EDA or analysis (e.g., `gpa_distribution.png`, `gradeclass_by_extracurricular.png`).
- **Metrics/Reports**: Files with model evaluation metrics (e.g., `model_performance_metrics.json` with accuracy, precision, recall).

## Notes

- These files are generated by scripts in the `src` folder or notebooks in the `notebook` folder.
- Avoid manually editing files in this folder to ensure reproducibility.
- Large files (e.g., models) may be excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
