# Src Folder

## Overview

This folder contains reusable source code, scripts, and modules for the `BrightPath-Grade-Predictor` project, including data processing, modeling, and utility functions.

## Contents

- **Data Processing Scripts**: Scripts for loading, cleaning, and transforming data (e.g., `data_preprocessing.py`).
- **Modeling Scripts**: Code for model training and prediction (e.g., `model.py`).
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions (e.g., `utils.py` for plotting, saving models, or metrics).
- **Pipeline Scripts**: End-to-end pipeline scripts (e.g., `pipeline.py` to run the full workflow).

## Notes

- Write modular, well-documented code to ensure reusability.
- Outputs (e.g., models, predictions) should be saved to the `artifacts` folder.
- Use functions from this folder in notebooks (`notebook`) for consistent processing.
